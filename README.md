## General info
This web page is being created for the Architecture and Construction Management firm "Likha". It's purpose is to give their potential clients a glimpse into what this firm can offer them, display some of their previous projects, and to give visitors a way to connect with them via email easily for further enquiries.
This project as well is a way to reinforce knowledge from courses and to build a project entirely on my own, as well as working with real life clients and requirements.

## Technologies

The site is currently being developed using plain HTML 5 and CSS 3, as well as Bootstrap 4.

## Setup

As this project is only built using mostly HTML without any backend technology or npm package, it doesnt need any type of setup to run locally.

## Project status

The project is currently being developed. There are still sections to be developed, as well as details to be fixed and new information to be added.
